Today, I studied a high level overview of the testing process.  There are different steps in the test process and the major areas are listed below.

1.	Planning
2.	Monitoring & Control
3.	Analysis
4.	Design
5.	Implementation
6.	Execution
7.	Completion

Planning 
 Where we write our test plan

Monitoring and Control 
    Comparing our actual progress to the expected progress that is written inside our test plan.  If they are the same, continue with testing.  If they are different, control activities or corrective actions are performed in order to follow the plan.

Analyze
    Analyze our requirements, search for defects inside it and analyze in order to find test conditions or test scenarios.  

Design
    Where we begin to write our test cases

Implementation
    Organize test cases into test suites and design our test environment.  The test environment is where we are doing our testing. i.e simulator, emulator, Google Chrome, Firefox, Android, Windows, etc.  

Execution
    Execute tests, find defects, report them, perform retesting and regression testing 

Completion
    Write test progress reports and test summary reports
