I first got into web development when I was in high school.  My high school had a Web Design class as an elective and I took it my senior year. For this class, we made small websites like, ‘describe your favorite movie’, ‘make a page for your pet’, etc.  Web technology was not as advanced as it is now.  Most webpages at the time were HTML, inline styling, and tables.  The fanciest we got was changing the colors of the page and changing the font colors.  As I reflect, I really loved that class because I could make something appear out of nothing on the Internet, which was really enjoyable for me.  

While in college, pursuing a major in the health field, it didn’t occur to me that I could make a career out of creating websites.  I thought it was just something people did for fun; I took my web skills for granted. 

After I graduated college, I took a few jobs in the health field but then had a hard realization: I really wanted to work in tech.  At the time, I felt it was forgone because I’d already gone to college for something completely different and would have to do about 3 years of coursework in order to take up something like Computer Science.  At that time, it wasn’t an option for me.  

I went to Google and typed in “how to get a job making websites.”  This was during the infancy of the “learn to code” movement that happened about 5 or 6 years ago.  I read blogs of people who taught themselves to code and were now working for tech companies as software developers.  I could learn the skills I need to build websites and enter into the tech field!?  Sweet!  Sign me up!  That night, I did some introductory courses in HTML and CSS.  I brought home some books from the library and went all in.

The going began to get tough though; there weren’t as many great resources to teach yourself web development at the time.  I found myself going in circles and repeating the basics I was comfortable with.  It was hard to find something that was for the advanced beginner.  I was learning on my own, attending Meetups, trying to level up, getting discouraged, giving up, then deciding to try again.  This cycle happened over and over again for months.  I was aware that there were some gaps in my knowledge.  The past 2 years I went even harder at learning to code. I’ve taken numerous courses, subscribed to online learning platforms, built some small projects, attended conferences, hackathons, and study groups, anything to immerse myself in the field.  I did some self-examining and decided the best step for me would be to attend a coding bootcamp.  Which brings me here to Flatiron School.  

I’m excited to see what these next few months of the bootcamp will bring.  I’m looking forward to learning and meeting others who desire to enter this field.  I’m hopeful that I will soon land a position as a Software Developer.
